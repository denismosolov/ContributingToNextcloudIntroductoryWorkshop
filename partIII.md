### Open Source Diversity

![Good first Issues](https://github.com/sleepypioneer/ContributingToNextcloudIntroductoryWorkshop/blob/master/images/osd.jpeg)

Have you always wanted to contribute to Free and Open Source Software but don't know where to start? Are you a member of an underrepresented group in open source?

Mentors from all kinds of Free and Open Source Projects are here to help you get started with contributing. Also feel free to just exchange ideas about Free and Open Source Software, the community and future projects.

Our mentors include people from projects like: Firefox, Nextcloud, Wikidata, Mediawiki (the software that powers Wikipedia) and more.

Ask questions on IRC: #opensourcediversity (https://riot.im/app/#/room/#opensourcediversity:matrix.org)
