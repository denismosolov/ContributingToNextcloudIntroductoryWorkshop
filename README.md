# :computer: Contributing To Nextcloud Introductory Workshop
Interested in contributing to Nextcloud but not sure how? In this introductory workshop we will guide you in getting your development environment set up and starting your first issue.

This will be an 1:15hr guided session with the final 45 minutes working on your own first issue supported by some of the Nextcloud and Open Source Diversity team.

This workshop is being run with support from Open Source Diversity, a monthly Meetup in Berlin that provides a friendly and safe environment for contributing to open source.

We look forward to getting you started with contributing to Nextcloud Open Source software!

An open source project is its contributors. Over 1000 people have code in Nextcloud. About a 10th of those have direct access to the code in our repository, contributing regularly. Besides coders, there are designers, Nextcloud advocates, translators, forum admins and many others who are part of our community.

### Ways to contribute
* [Develop your own App](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/14/developer_manual/app/)
* Improve existing Nextcloud code *(if your new to software development, good first issues are a good place to start)*
* [Review new code](https://nextcloud.com/blog/get-involved-in-nextcloud-by-reviewing-pulls/)
* Help with translations
* Help with the Design *(go to the [design page](https://nextcloud.com/contribute/design/))*
* Test the software
*(Testing upcoming Nextcloud Server releases is the best way of making sure the new release can do what you need it to do. And of course, only if you report a problem to us we know about it and can fix it!
