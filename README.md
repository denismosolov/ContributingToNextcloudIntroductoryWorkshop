# :computer: Contributing To Nextcloud Introductory Workshop
Interested in contributing to Nextcloud but not sure how? In this introductory workshop we will guide you in getting your development environment set up and starting your first issue.

This workshop is being run with support from Open Source Diversity, a monthly Meetup in Berlin that provides a friendly and safe environment for contributing to open source.

We look forward to getting you started with contributing to Nextcloud Open Source software!

# :cloud: Nextcloud :cloud:

# :woman: Contribute :man:
*"Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine."*
https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/

An open source project is all about its contributors. Over 1000 people have code in Nextcloud. About a 10th of those have direct access to the code in our repository, contributing regularly. Besides coders, there are designers, Nextcloud advocates, translators, forum admins and many others who are part of our community.

With so many ways to get involved, what are you waiting for :smile:

### Ways to contribute
* [Develop your own App](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/14/developer_manual/app/)
* Improve existing Nextcloud code *(if your new to software development, good first issues are a good place to start)*
* [Review new code](https://nextcloud.com/blog/get-involved-in-nextcloud-by-reviewing-pulls/)
* Help with translations
* Help with the Design *(go to the [design page](https://nextcloud.com/contribute/design/))*
* Test the software
*(Testing upcoming Nextcloud Server releases is the best way of making sure the new release can do what you need it to do. And of course, only if you report a problem to us we know about it and can fix it! If you have a bug to report, find the [issue submission page.](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md))*

You can show publically on your Github account that you contribute to Nextcloud by setting yourself as public in the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/nextcloud/people)

# :memo: Running the Nextcloud development environment
You'll need to set up your development environment to test and programme on the Nextcloud codebase, the following guides are to get you started depending on which OS you are using. We will take time to go through these guides with you as each set up can be a little different and challenging. (we've all been there at some point :wink: )

* [Mac](https://github.com/sleepypioneer/ContributingToNextcloudIntroductoryWorkshop/blob/master/NextcloudMacDevelopmentEnvironment.md)
* [Linux (with VM)](https://github.com/David-Development/nextcloud-dev-docker/blob/master/README.md)
* Windows [with Docker](https://github.com/David-Development/nextcloud-dev-docker/blob/master/README.md)
          [or with a VM](https://github.com/sleepypioneer/ContributingToNextcloudIntroductoryWorkshop/blob/master/NextcloudWindowsDevelopmentEnvironment.md)

# :pen: Other useful Tools

* [IRC communication Tool]()
* [Git with a github account]()
* [IDE /Text editor (Visual studio Code - open source)]()
* [Nextcloud Docs]()

### IRC Chat

https://about.riot.im/
https://riot.im/app/#/room/#freenode_#nextcloud-dev:matrix.org

### Github & Github Desktop

In order to contribute to the code base and checkout the latest versions you will need to make a free github account, you can so [here](https://github.com)

https://github.com/nextcloud

Commands to git can be done through the terminal on windows you will also need to install git

Alternatively you can use the Github Desktop GUI which you can download [here](https://desktop.github.com/) *(we reccomend this for complete beginners to Git)*

### IDE / Text Editor

To work on the code base you will need a IDE or Text Editor. 
Here you have complete choice and it is a personal preference which you find best to work with, however we can highly reccomend Visual Studio Code below are also some others you may like to try (they are all free)

### Nextcloud Documentation
Nextcloud already has a vast amount of documentation for getting started, style guides and about how the code base is structured. You need to make sure you are working within these guidelines when you are fixing issues so it is very useful to keep them at hand!

This also includes their code of conduct, if you encounter behaviour aimed at yourself or other that goes against this code do not be afraid to report it! https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/14/developer_manual/general/code-of-conduct.html
