# Part II
# :computer: Contributing To Nextcloud Introductory Workshop 

Now you have the development set up and all the tools for contributing it's time to get the code and pick an issue to work on!

## Cloning a Repo to your machine

To start working on an issue or a feature for a repository (nextcloud server or one of the app for example) you will need to download (clone) the project to your local setup.

`git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/server`

## Forking a Repo

Usually you don't have permissions to a repository that does not belong to you. To allow you to edit the code, you can *fork* the repository to your own account. That means you can clone the project and start coding on your account.

## Creating your own Branch

On your local clone, you will need to create a new branch to start adding your modifications. Just checkout the branch you want to edit (usually master)

`git checkout master`

and then create a new branch based on the one we just selected

`git checkout -B your-branch-name`

## Running your Nextcloud version

# Viewing your code in the Browser with Dev Tools

* Viewing elements
* Moving elements in Dev tools
* Viewing styles
* Changings styles in Dev tools
* Moving elements in code base and seeing them in browser
* Changing styles in code base and seeing them in browser

## Picking your first issue

We will now get in small groups and decide on issues to start on.
